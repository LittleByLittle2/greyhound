# GREYHOUND

A point cloud streaming framework for dynamic web services and native applications.

See it in action with the dynamic [Plas.io](http://speck.ly) client at [speck.ly](http://speck.ly) and the [Potree](http://potree.org) client at [potree.entwine.io](http://potree.entwine.io).

# NOTE

Greyhound is **not** used with the current [Entwine](https://github.com/connormanning/entwine) workflow.  For the latest Entwine workflow, follow Entwine's readme and documentation.  Greyhound is not a requirement to visualize Entwine data any more.  For details, see [this pull request](https://github.com/connormanning/entwine/pull/98).  This repository is only in use for the Entwine `1.x` releases.

# Usage
See the [client documentation](https://github.com/hobu/greyhound/blob/master/doc/source/clientDevelopment.rst) if you are interested in developing an application that streams data from Greyhound.  For instructions regarding configuring and deploying Greyhound, see the [administrator documentation](https://github.com/hobu/greyhound/blob/master/doc/source/administration.rst).
